# 🧬 3D In-Vitro Lead Intelligence Agent  

An **AI-assisted decision intelligence pipeline** designed to help life-science teams
**identify who to engage, why they matter, and why now** in the 3D in-vitro ecosystem.
The system combines scientific signals, business context, and ML-assisted ranking to help teams decide who to engage, why they matter, and why now.

## 📊 Live Demo

Interactive Streamlit dashboard demonstrating persona-driven lead identification and prioritization:

👉 http://localhost:8501/

## 📄 Sample Output (Reference Run)

To illustrate the system’s output, the repository includes a **sample result snapshot**
generated using the following configuration:

- **Role Persona:** Head of Preclinical Safety  
- **Scientific Context:** Hepatic spheroids  

The output represents a ranked list of adoption-ready stakeholders, enriched with
scientific activity, funding context, fit classification, and recommended actions.

> Note: This is a reference run provided for demonstration purposes.  
> The live dashboard dynamically recomputes results based on selected personas
> and scientific context.


## 🏛️ High-Level Architecture

The system is built as an **agent-style orchestration pipeline**, executed on-demand
from a Streamlit interface and composed of clearly separated stages:

User Inputs (Persona + Scientific Context)
        ↓
Identification Layer
  • LinkedIn-like professional discovery (Mock API)
  • Scientific signal discovery (Real PubMed API)
        ↓
Enrichment Layer
  • Funding stage & budget readiness (Mock API)
  • Location & hub intelligence
        ↓
Decision Intelligence Engine
  • Feature engineering
  • ML-assisted propensity scoring (Random Forest)
  • Business rule interpretation
        ↓
Ranked Dashboard Output
  • Fit classification
  • Recommended outreach action


The pipeline executes each time the user runs the Data Pipeline from the UI.

## 🔄 Pipeline Stages
Stage 1: Identification

The agent identifies relevant professionals based on:

Role persona (e.g., Director of Toxicology, Head of Preclinical Safety)

Scientific context (e.g., DILI, hepatic models, organ-on-chip)

Sources:

Mocked professional network API (LinkedIn / Xing equivalent)

Real PubMed (NCBI E-utilities) API for recent publications

Stage 2: Enrichment

Each identified profile is enriched with:

Company funding stage (Series A/B, Seed, Public, etc.)

Budget readiness inference

Geographic context (HQ vs remote, major biotech hubs)

This layer converts raw profiles into commercially interpretable entities.

Stage 3: Decision Intelligence & Ranking

The enriched leads are passed through a decision intelligence engine that:

Performs feature engineering (seniority, funding, hub presence)

Uses a Random Forest classifier to estimate adoption propensity

Translates scores into human-readable insights

Outputs include:

Propensity to Collaborate (%)

Scientific + Business Fit (High / Medium / Low)

Recommended Action

High Priority Outreach

Warm Lead

Monitor

This ensures the output is actionable, not just ranked.

## 🧠 Key Design Decisions & Problems Addressed
**1️⃣ Explainability over Black-Box ML**

Problem: Pure ML scoring is difficult for BD teams to trust.
Solution: ML is used to assist ranking, while business rules clearly interpret outcomes into fit levels and actions.

**2️⃣ Compliance-Aware Data Strategy**

Problem: Scraping platforms like LinkedIn violates ToS and is unreliable.
Solution: Proprietary sources are abstracted via mocked APIs, while PubMed is accessed through its official public API, preserving a production-ready architecture without compliance risk.

**3️⃣ Timing-Aware Lead Prioritization**

Problem: Relevance alone does not indicate urgency or readiness.
Solution: The system explicitly surfaces:

Recent scientific activity

Funding recency

Decision-making seniority

This aligns ranking with budget timing and adoption readiness.

**4️⃣ Persona-Driven Decision Context**

Problem: Different stakeholders prioritize different signals.
Solution: The agent accepts persona and scientific context as first-class inputs, enabling scenario-specific prioritization.

## 📈 Output & Usability

The final dashboard provides:

Ranked, searchable lead list

Clear prioritization logic

Export-ready structure for downstream workflows

The system is designed to support real BD decision-making, not just data exploration.
